# Managing USD–INR Exposure: Cost Sensitivity, Profit Impact, and Hedging Performance

## Overview

This repository presents a financial modelling study that evaluates how USD–INR exchange rate movements impact production costs and profitability in an import-dependent manufacturing firm.

The study also assesses how partial hedging strategies can reduce earnings volatility and protect operating margins.

The model is designed to reflect how a finance or treasury team would analyse foreign exchange risk in a practical business setting.

## Objectives

- Measure the impact of USD–INR movements on import-linked costs  
- Evaluate effects on monthly and quarterly profitability  
- Compare hedged vs unhedged profit outcomes  
- Assess profit volatility under different exchange rate scenarios  
- Evaluate the effectiveness of partial hedging in reducing risk

---

## Business Context

The simulated firm:

- Operates in the manufacturing sector  
- Imports a portion of raw materials in USD  
- Sells finished goods in INR  
- Has ₹300 per unit directly exposed to USD–INR movements  
- Faces margin pressure when INR depreciates

This structure reflects many real-world Indian manufacturing firms with import dependence.

## Methodology

The model uses:

- Scenario-based analysis (Base, Favourable, Adverse)  
- Monthly and quarterly profit modelling  
- Cost sensitivity analysis  
- Volatility measurement using high–low range  
- Partial hedging analysis at a fixed forward rate  

Exchange rate scenarios are derived using ETS forecasting based on historical USD–INR data.

## Key Insights

- INR depreciation increases import cost and compresses margins  
- Unhedged positions show significant profit volatility  
- Partial hedging reduces volatility by approximately 50%  
- Hedging provides downside protection during adverse currency movements  
- In favourable scenarios, hedging may limit upside but improves stability
